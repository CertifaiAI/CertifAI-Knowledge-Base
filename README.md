# Supporting a user with an Issue
### Step 1: Problem Identifying

Here's a [Supporting Guidelines](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/CertifAI-Knowledge-Base/blob/main/SupportGuidelines.md) that may help you to identify user's problem.

### Step 2: Check for Solutions in wiki

List of solutions are provided in [wiki](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/certifai-wiki/wiki). 

### Step 3: Reply to user

- **If solution found in wiki**, you can reply the user with the link.

- **If solution not found in wiki**, [raise an issue](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/CertifAI-Knowledge-Base#raising-issue) first, then send the issue link to user. Once documentation is ready in wiki, inform the user.

Here's a [reply template](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/CertifAI-Knowledge-Base/wiki/Message-Template-for-Support) you can refer. It's optional to use this, but remember to be polite and professional.
